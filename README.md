# Inspectron
Inspectron applies PyLint to a given directory and generates a report for one to check for improvements.
It uses a template located in the outputs folder to generate the report. It only works for .py files

## Usage
Clone this repo to your local machine. Navigate towards the directory you cloned it in,
Simply run the next command in the terminal to run the project.

```
python3 main.py {directory name}
```

> [!TIP]
> Check out the config.json to change the configurations

## What does PyLint check for?
```
Pylint analyses your code without actually running it. It checks for errors, enforces a coding standard, looks for code smells,
and can make suggestions about how the code could be refactored.
